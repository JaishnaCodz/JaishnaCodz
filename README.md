## 💼 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student passionate about using **data** to uncover insights and drive decisions.  
Over the past year, I've worked with tools like **Python**, **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Tableau** to analyze, visualize, and communicate data-driven stories.  

I believe in *clarity through visuals*, and I'm especially interested in the intersection of **cloud computing**, **AI**, and **analytics**.  
Currently, I'm experimenting with building **cloud-based ML apps**, learning new tools, and working on practical mini-projects.
